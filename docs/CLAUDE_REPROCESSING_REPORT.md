## 🎯 Key Achievement: Authentic Worldview Naming

### Critical User Feedback

**User Request**: "세계관 이름이 의도한대호 만들어지지 않았는데 이거 먼저 개선해야할거 같은데 그들의 언어와 시각으로 표현되어야해"

Translation: Worldview names should be expressed in DC Gallery users' actual language and perspective, not academic/objective terms.

### Before (Academic/Objective)
❌ "즉시 단정형 음모론 세계관"
❌ "역사 반복 필연론 세계관"
❌ "외부 세력 침투론 세계관"

### After (Authentic DC User Language)
✅ "중국/좌파가 댓글부대로 여론을 조작한다"
✅ "현 정부는 과거 독재처럼 국민을 탄압한다"
✅ "좌빨들이 대한민국을 망치려고 음모를 꾸민다"

## 🏗 Technical Implementation

### 4-Stage Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Archive Old Data
```python
# Archived 7 old worldviews
# Archived 499 old perceptions
# Deleted 541 old links
```

#### Stage 2: LayeredPerceptionExtractor
- **Strategy**: Baseline ("Less is More")
- **Output**: explicit_claims, implicit_assumptions, deep_beliefs
- **Success**: 455/456 contents

#### Stage 3: ReasoningStructureExtractor
- **Strategy**: StepByStep (progressive checklist)
- **Output**: mechanisms (5 types), actor (subject/purpose/methods), logic_chain
- **Success**: 100% mechanism detection

#### Stage 4: WorldviewEvolutionEngine
- **Strategy**: Data-Driven (statistical pattern discovery)
- **Input**: 200 recent perceptions (sample-based analysis)
- **Output**: 7 worldviews with authentic DC user language
- **Key Improvement**: Enhanced prompt with explicit naming guidelines

#### Stage 5: MechanismMatcher
- **Strategy**: Adaptive Weighting
  - Normal events: Actor 50%, Mechanism 30%, Logic 20%
  - Extreme events (4+ mechanisms): Actor 30%, Mechanism 50%, Logic 20%
- **Output**: 418 links with relevance scores
- **Key Fix**: Handle both dict and string actor formats

## 🔧 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Method Naming Issue
**Error**: `'ReasoningStructureExtractor' object has no attribute 'extract_structure'`
**Solution**: Changed to `extract()` method which creates perception internally

### 2. API Credit Exhaustion
**Error**: Failed at content #131 due to insufficient Anthropic credits
**Solution**: User added credits, restarted processing successfully

### 3. Worldview Structure Mismatch
**Error**: `KeyError: 'frame'`
**Solution**: Built frame structure manually from engine output:
```python
frame = {
    'actor': wv.get('actor', {}),
    'core_mechanisms': wv.get('core_mechanisms', []),
    'logic_pattern': wv.get('logic_pattern', {}),
    'statistical_basis': wv.get('statistical_basis', {})
}
```

### 4. Database Constraint Violation
**Error**: `null value in column "overall_valence" violates not-null constraint`
**Solution**: Added default value `'overall_valence': 0.0`

### 5. Actor Type Handling
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'replace'`
**Solution**: Added type checking in MechanismMatcher to handle both dict and string formats:
```python
worldview_actor_data = frame.get('actor', '')
if isinstance(worldview_actor_data, dict):
    worldview_actor = worldview_actor_data.get('subject', '')
else:
    worldview_actor = worldview_actor_data
```

### 6. Worldview Naming Authenticity (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Generated names were too academic
**User Feedback**: Must use DC Gallery users' actual language
**Solution**: Enhanced prompt with explicit guidelines and examples
**Result**: 7 worldviews with natural, authentic user language

## 🎯 Prompt Engineering Insights

### What Worked

1. **Baseline Strategy (Perception)**
   - "Less is More" approach
   - Minimal instructions, maximum Claude intelligence
   - Result: High quality 3-layer analysis

2. **StepByStep Strategy (Structure)**
   - Progressive checklist format
   - Explicit mechanism definitions
   - Result: 100% mechanism detection

3. **Data-Driven Strategy (Evolution)**
   - Statistical pattern presentation
   - Top mechanisms, actors, logic chains
   - **Critical Addition**: Explicit naming guidelines with examples
   - Result: Authentic DC user language worldviews

4. **Adaptive Weighting (Matcher)**

   - Mechanism-focused for extreme events
   - Result: Better matching accuracy

### Key Lesson

**User Language Matters**: The most critical improvement came from explicit guidance to use DC Gallery users' actual language and perspective, not academic/analytical terms. This required:
- Negative examples (what NOT to do)
- Positive examples (authentic user language)
- Format specification: "[행위자]는/가 [행동]한다"
- Tone specification: "DC Gallery 사용자가 직접 말하는 것처럼"
